# convexopt-book1

Convex optimization for statistics and machine learning. 

To make this more manageable, I decided to separate out this effort
into two books: book 1 for analysis, and book 2 for algorithms. 

(Still, will I ever finish? One can be hopeful.)

This repo is for book 1. Currently I'm done with Parts 2 and 3.

Plan: 
- [ ] Write Part 4 (duality and optimality)
    - [x] Lagrange duality
    - [x] KKT conditions
    - [ ] Duality correspondences 
- [ ] Write Part 5 (case studies on lasso and SVMs)
- [ ] Work on/solicit ideas for Part 6 (advanced topics)
- [ ] Write Part 1 (intro) and appendix
