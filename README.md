# convexopt-book1

Convex optimization for statistics and machine learning. 

I decided to separate out this effort into two books: 
book 1 for analysis, and book 2 for algorithms. 

This repo is for book 1. Currently I'm done with Parts 2 and 3.

Plan: 
- Write Part 4 (duality and optimality)
- Get feedback on Parts 2-4, which make up (more or less) core topics
  for a graduate course on convex analysis
- Write Part 5 (case studies on lasso and SVMs), get feedback
- Solicit ideas for Part 6 (advanced topics)
- Write Part 1 (intro) and appendix
