# convexopt-book1

Convex optimization for statistics and machine learning. 

To make this more manageable, I decided to separate out this effort
into two books: book 1 for analysis, and book 2 for algorithms. 
Book 2 has no GitHub repo at the moment.

(Will I ever finish? One can be hopeful.)

This repo is for book 1. Currently I'm done with Parts 1-3.

Tentative plan: 
- [x] Write Part 3 (duality and optimality)
    - [x] Lagrange duality
    - [x] KKT conditions
    - [x] Duality correspondences
- [ ] Collect ideas for Part 4 (advanced topics). Some ideas:
  * Bregman divergences, projections, proximals?
  * Uniqueness without strict convexity?
  * Caratheodory theorems on sparsity?
  * Perturbation/sensitivity analysis?
  * Fine properties of the lasso?
- [ ] Write the motivational chapters and technical appendices
