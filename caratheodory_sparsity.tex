\chapter{Carath\'{e}odory's Theorems on Sparsity}
\label{chap:charactheodory_sparsity}

1. Caratheodory right away to go from a generic solution to a solution on n+1 
features 

2. KKT conditions to prove that the solution from step 1 has affine dimension
n-1 (not n). As in Section 2.2 of this paper:
\url{https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/lassounique.pdf}.  

3. Caratheodory theorem one more to prove that the solution therefore is
supported on n features, since Caratheodory at the end of the day is a story
about affine independence, so all that matters is the affine dimension of the
points in question (not the ambient dimension) 

- Lasso
- Infinite-dimensional lasso, like Saharon \& friends: \url{https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.111.4874&rep=rep1&type=pdf}
- Locally adaptive regression splines?
- Group lasso????
